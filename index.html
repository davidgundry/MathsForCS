              <p class="lead">Computer science developed out of the field of mathematics. Maths is involved in some way
                  in almost every aspect of computer science, from algorithmic complexity to artificial intellegence, from
                  human-computer interation research to game design. This course will teach a set of core tools that
                  will come in handy throughout your studies and future career.

            <h3 class="text-center">A precice langauge</h3>
            <p>Maths gives you a precice formal language to communicate ideas. Formal notation avoids ambiguity and confusion.
                This is essential for writing algorithms or implementing algorithms in code.

            <h3 class="text-center">Write better code</h3>
            <p>Having a good understanding of mathematical concepts helps you solve problems in code. Using standard mathemtical
                formalisms like sets and graphs makes your code easier to understand by others.</p>

            <p>We will be taking a problem-centered approach to learning maths. The analytical thinking needed for maths is the 
                same that you need for analysing problems.
