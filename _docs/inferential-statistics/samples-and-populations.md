We are going to learn about what it means to sample from a population. While a **population** is a group of people or things that you are interested in (e.g. university students), a **sample** is a subset of that group that you can actually measure (e.g. the people who take part in my experiment). The goal of inferential statistics is to use that sample to learn something about the population as a whole.

Watch the video and then answer the questions below.

## Key Points

* We use a **sample** to infer knowledge about a **population**.
* **Inference** in statistics is about constructing a convincing argument.
* A **population** is the group of people or things that we're interested in. This might be every human being, or every output that an algorithm will ever give.
* A **sample** is the group we actually measure: the people who do our experiment, or the algorithm outputs that we collect.
* **Validity** is how convincing your inference argument is. Did you measure what you think you measured (e.g. physiological reaction times in humans)? Or did you _actually_ measure something else (physiological reaction times in over-worked undergraduate students)?

## Questions

### 1. Check your understanding

##### 1. Roulette

Roulette is a casino game where a numbered wheel is spun by a croupier. A ball is spun in the opposite direction and eventually lands in one of the 37 (or 38) numbers.

If you suspected this wheel was biased and ran a study to prove it, what would your population be?

1. Every result that this croupier gets while spinning the wheel
2. The results while you are sat at the table
3. Results from any roulette wheel
4. Every result from this roulette wheel

What would your sample be?

1. The results for this croupier, in this casino, on this day
2. The results you are able to record
3. The biased results you observe
4. Every result from this roulette wheel

What does it mean for a sample to be biased?

1. It is not randomly drawn from the population
2. It has characteristics in common that are not shared by the wider population
3. The results are not interesting

## Summary

In this section we have learned about sampling from a population and threats to validity involved. Once you've completed the questions, you can move on to the next section about [hypothesis testing](../hypothesis-testing/).
