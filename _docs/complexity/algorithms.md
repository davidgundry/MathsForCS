## Questions

### 1. Check your understanding

### 2. More questions
Look at this algorithm. Is it definite?

Write an algorithm for
    â€¢ baking a cake

Run the provided code and record the time taken. Copy and plot the numbers on a graph using Excel or Libre Office. (From Repl.it they may be very noisy)
Which one do you think is faster for values of z < 1000?
Which one do you think will be faster for values of z > 1000?


Match the function to the graph. You might want to use [this online calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) to help

1. y=x
2. y=x2
3. y = x!
4. y = log x
5. y = 1


## Summary

In this section we have learned about algorithms. In the next section we learn about [asymptotic complexity](../asymptotic-complexity/).
