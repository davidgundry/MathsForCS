title:  "Switch to Java"
author: David Gundry
---

I have switched the programming language used in this course from Python to Java. Originally the plan was that you would be taught Python in your Introduction to Programming module. However, you're now going to be taught Java instead.

I don't want you to have to learn a whole other language to do this maths course - that's not what it's about. Content that has already been produced in Python will still be available, but future content will be developed in Java.

For the assessment you will be free to work in either Python or Java.
