Welcome to this course! I hope you enjoy it.

You will see not all of the content is online yet. The later content is still being created, and will come online when it is ready. It's quite a bit of work, so appologies if there are bugs or typos. Let me know, and I will try to fix them.

If you enter a soluton for one of the questions and the auto-checking tells you it's wrong but you are certain it is right, then send me a message on Teams (or email if you must). It might be that I've messed up somewhere. Setting up the auto-checked questions is a bit fiddly, so I wouldn't be surprised if I've made some mistakes here and there.

Finally, if you get stuck with the questions, don't stress too much. The most important thing is to cover all the video content before the practical session. You can always come back to questions you have left. If you do find yourself panicing and stressing about the course, feel free to message me on Teams.
