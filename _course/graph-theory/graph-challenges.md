We will be working on these challenges in the lab session for this topic.

You do not have to complete these in advance. However you may choose to get started on them in advance if you wish. You still need to attend the lab even if you have completed the challenges! If you do not complete them in the lab it is recommended that you finish them in your own time.

## Implementing a graph

Because of the variation possible in implemented a graph, it's unlikely you will find graphs built in to any programming language. That means you will need to write them yourself if you need them. And because graphs are so useful, you almost certainly will.

### Task 1

Using the provided code above, implement a graph in Java.

### Task 2

Add a `degree` function on the `Node` class

### Task 3

Write a function in Java that returns an adjacency matrix for a given graph.

### Task 4

Write a function in Java that calculates the maximum and minimum degree of a graph
