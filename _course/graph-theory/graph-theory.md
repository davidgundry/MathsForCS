    <h3 class="text-center">Problem Solving</h3>
    <p>Graphs are powerful abstractions to help us solve problems in computer science, such as routing internet traffic or finding the maximum flow through a network of pipes.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Games</h3>
    <p>Where games use discrete choises or states (such as board games, stratregy games, etc.) it can be helpful to represent them as graphs. Many common algorithms in games, such as for pathfinding and AI, use graphs.</p>
