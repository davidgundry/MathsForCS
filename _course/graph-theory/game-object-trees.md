_In this video I'm going to be talking - **at a very high level** - about how graphs can be used for working in different problem domains. Rather than focusing on formalism or definitions, I want to show you how graphs can be used. Hopefully this will help you use graphs to solve problems that you encounter._

In this video I talk about how trees can be used in game engines to relate game objects (e.g. shapes, audio, scripts) to one another in useful ways.

**Important:** You will not be tested on the problem domain! I do not expect you to learn about game engines! If this video is helpful to you, great! If not, don't worry about it!

## Key Points

1. A tree can be used to structure objects into a heirarchy
2. Heirarchical structures can make it easier to perform operations on groups of things at once.
3. Operating on heirarchical structures can minimse complexity. 

Tree structures allow game engines to, for example:

1. Position objects relative to their parent
2. Enable and disable groups of objects
3. Set properties for groups of objects at once

## Summary

In this section we saw game engines can structure game objects in a heirarchy using trees to allow tasks to be performed with minimal complexity.
