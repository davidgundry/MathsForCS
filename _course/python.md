## Repl.it

In this module, we'll be making use of [Repl.it](http://https://repl.it), an online IDE (integrated development environment) for Python (among other langauges). You will see embedded runable code windows in the course. They look a bit like this:

You are also able to open the code in a full window by clicking the button in the embedded Repl.it frame. You can save your code by creating an account on Repl.it.

You can find all the code for this course on [Repl.it](https://repl.it/repls/folder/MathsForCS)

## Running Unit Tests

Several of the exercises give you a number of pre-written unit tests. These unit tests are to help you know when you've got the right answer. But just because the tests pass does not mean you code is correct - they are necessary, but not sufficient. It is possible to right code to pass the tests but not answer the question you've been given! Don't do that!

The assessment for this module will involve writing code. I will provide unit tests for this as well, so it's a good idea to get the hang of how they work as you make your way through the course.

You can tell a project has tests because there will be several additional files, including `tests.py`, and a `.replit` file. You want to write your code in `main.py`.

When you run the project in Repl.it, it will run the tests. Make sure you name your functions correctly (as the question tells you to) so the tests can find them. Give it a try here:
