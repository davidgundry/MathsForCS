## Key Points

Data visualisation is important to help other people (and yourself) understand your data. In the academic literature there are standard ways certain types of data are represented.

### Bar charts
* Compares values on a common scale
* Shows the ratio between values
* Appropriate for categorical variables

### Histogram
* Like a bar chart, but continuous values are grouped into bins
* Appropriate for continuous variables

### Box plots
* Visualises distribution of data
* Shows mean, upper quartile, lower quartile, and range
* Commonly used for illustrating hypothesis tests

### Pie charts
* Shows proportions of a whole
* Hard to visually compare values and generally avoided in the research literature
* A bar chart is a better choice
