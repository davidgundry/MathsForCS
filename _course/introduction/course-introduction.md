This lecture will be delivered live, so there are not any videos to watch. The content of the course will be introduced, and we will talk about what mathematics _is_.

Most of the time maths is taught as a bunch of disconnected rules for solving particular problems: how to add numbers, how to differentiate a function, and so on. And these rules are often exceedingly useful. However, I find it helpful to have a broader perspective that puts these rules in context. To me, at least, it makes maths seem less intimidating and more like... a game.

I'll be giving a mostly [Formalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics#Formalism) account, but there are other ways of thinking about maths. And if you're not big on philosophy, you don't need to worry about this bit.

The slides for the introduction to the course [are available here](/assets/introduction.pdf)

During the first week's practical, we will be working on the challenges found [here](../first-challenges)
