    <p>Unlike science, mathematical proof is one of the few cases where we can ever be certain that something is true.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Mathematics</h3>
    <p>Proof is essential to all branches of mathematics. By proving things, mathematicians have built up all the knowledge about arithmetic, geometry, logic, sets, probability, ... that we have been relying on thoughout this course</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Security</h3>
    <p>Proof is expected in some fields, like cryptography and safety-critical systems, where you need to be really sure that your algorithm does what you think it does.</p>
