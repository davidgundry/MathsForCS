## Key Points

### Definitions

* A **conjecture** is something we think might be right - something that is interesting enough to try and prove.
* A **theorem** is a conjecture that has a proof - so long as the proof is valid, theorems must be true.
* A **proof** is a matematical argument that a theorem is true, or it is the activity of creating such an argument.
* A **lemma** is intermediary conclusion that is proved as part of proving a theorem.
* A **corrolary** is something that follows directly once a theorem has been proved.
