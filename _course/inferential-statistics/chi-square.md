## Key Points

* The chi-square test calculates the Chi-Square statistic
* The Chi-Square statistic can be converted to a p-value

<p class="math">\[ \Chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} \]</p>

Where \\( O_i \\) is an observed value, \\( E_i \\) is an expected value, and \\( n \\) is the number of such values.
