We are going to learn about a common inferential statistic called the Student's T-Test (it was published under the psedonym 'Student'). It is a so-called **parametric** test, becuase it assumes your data follows a **normal distribution**.

Watch the video and then answer the questions below.

## Key Points

* The t-test calculates the T statistic
* The T statistic can be converted to a p-value
* The t-test assumes our data is normally distributed

## Questions

### 1. Check your understanding

### 2. Implementing the T-Test

Write a function that takes two arrays of numbers and calculates the t-statistic.

Write a function that takes a t-statistic and the degrees of freedom and returns its p-value.

## Summary

In this section we have learned about sampling from a population and threats to validity involved. Once you've completed the questions, you can move on to the next section about [hypothesis testing](../hypothesis-testing/).
