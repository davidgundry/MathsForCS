## Getting started

This website holds all of the content for the Maths for CS course. The course is divided into several topics, one for each week of the course. Each topic is broken down into multiple sections. Each section has a short video lecture and questions and challenges for you to complete. Each week there will also be a live lab session with the demonstrator. You should complete each section before that week's lab session. During the lab we will build on what you have learned.

| Week          | Topic         |
| ------------- |-------------  |
| Week 1        | [Numerical Systems](../numerical-systems) |
| Week 2        | [Modulo Arithmatic](../modulo-arithmatic)  |
| Week 3        | [Asymptotic Complexity](/complexity)      | 
| Week 4        | [Propositional Logic](../propositional-logic)      | 
| Week 5        | [Set Theory](../set-theory)      |
| Week 6        | [Graph Theory](../graph-theory)      |
| Week 7        | [Descriptive Statistics](../descriptive-statistics)     |
| Week 8        | [Probability](../probability)     | 
| Week 9        | [Inferential Statistics](../inferential-statistics)| 

## Outline of the course

This course will focus on presenting pratical situations where maths is needed to solve a problem. We will solve the problem together over the course of a topic, learning the maths we need as we go. On the way, you will be presented with problems to solve to develop your understanding of the material. Each section also has a number of challenges to test your ability on new problems. Completing these challenges will help you prepare for the exam

### Labs

Labs will be run online via Microsoft Teams. You will be added to the Teams group for this module. As well as attending scheduled lab sessions online, you can use this group to ask questions and discuss the course content with your peers. I will attempt to answer most questions via Teams so that everyone can see the answers.

### Support

This course is being run by [David Gundry](../who-am-i). You can contact me over Microsoft Teams. If you need to, you can also contact me by email at `d.gundry@yorksj.ac.uk`. If I give an answer by email to a question that I think might be helpful for the whole group, I'll post it to the Teams group.

### Assessment

This course is 100% assessed by coursework. The exam will be released `at some point`, and you will have until `some later point` to return your completed assessment. The assessment will present you with a number of problems that you have to solve. Many of the problems will require you to use a programming language. Throughout the course we will be using Python, and it is recommend you use that.

### Python

You will apply your mathematical knowledge to problems requiring programming in the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/). You will be taking the `Introduction to Programming` module alongside this one. That module will focus on teaching you how to use Python. In this module, you will have a chance to apply what you are learning.

For more about how to use Python in this course, see the [Python](../python) section.
