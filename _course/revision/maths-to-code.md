The lecture course was originally planned for there to be a reading week. So this is a bonus lecture. By popular request, it'll be on how to convert maths to code.

This lecture will be delivered live, so there are not any videos to watch.

The slides for this lecture are be [available here](/assets/maths-to-code.pdf)

During this week's practical, we will be working on the challenges found [here](../qgen)
