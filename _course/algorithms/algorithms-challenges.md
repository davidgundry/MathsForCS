We will be working on these challenges in the lab session for this topic.

You do not have to complete these in advance. However you may choose to get started on them in advance if you wish. You still need to attend the lab even if you have completed the challenges! If you do not complete them in the lab it is recommended that you finish them in your own time.

## Algorithm Analysis

The goal is to analyse a given Python function to assess the efficieny of its algorithm. We will do this both empirically (by collecting data) and theoretically (by working out the time function).

### Part 1

Run the provided code and record the time taken. Copy and plot the numbers on a graph using Excel or Libre Office. (From Repl.it they may be very noisy)

Which one do you think is faster for values of z < 1000?
Which one do you think will be faster for values of z > 1000?

### Part 2

Analyse the algorithm and work out its time function and its complexity.

From the numbers you have measured, work out the time it would take to run this algorithm for `z = 10<sup>10`

### Part 3

Is there a way to make this algorithm more efficient? If so, rewrite it. Now analyse it again and calculate the new complexity class. Now work out how long it will take to execute for `z = 10<sup>10`
