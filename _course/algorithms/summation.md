Many algorithms involve loops. In order to work out the time functions for these algorithms, we need to use summations. We will learn how summations work and how to work with them.

Watch the video and then answer the questions below.

## Key Points

* A **summation** is an adding up of lots of things.
* We write summations using **sigma notation**
* Converting from sigma notation to a polynomial expression requires some thought, and sometimes the use of some formulae.

### Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence

An arithmetic sequence is a series of numbers with a constant difference between them, e.g. `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...` In this sequence, the number increases by `1` each time.

To sum an arithmetic sequence you can use the formula

### Sum of a Geometric Sequence

A geometric sequence is a series of numbers where each number is found my multiplying the previous number by a constant e.g. `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...`. In this sequence, the number doubles every time.

To sum a geometric sequence you can use the formula
