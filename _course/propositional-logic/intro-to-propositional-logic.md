## Questions

### 1. Check your understanding

Which propositions are equivalent to TRUE and which are equivalent to
FALSE?

1.  11 + 12 = 22
2.  1<0
3.  12 × 3 = 36
4.  (( 3 × 4 + 22) × 2) ≠ 112

Identify which of the following are atomic propositions and which are compound propositions

1. Alice is older than 50
2. It is not the case that the earth is not flat
3. (30 × 10) < 500
4. If it is monday then I like pizza
5. “Cat” is a three letter word
6. I rolled a 1 on a six-sided die or I rolled a 6 on a six-sided die 

Give the negated form of each of the following:

1. FT212 is on the 2nd floor
2. Justin’s office is warm
3. n < y
4. my shoes fit my feet

The law of double negation states that the truth value of a proposition P is equivalent to the truth value of the proposition  ¬¬P. This can be written	¬¬P ⇔ P. Write out a truth table showing p, ¬P, and ¬¬P

Calculate the truth values for the following:
1. ¬(3 + 7 = 10)
2. ¬("The earth is flat")
3. ¬¬(3 + 1 = 10)
4. ¬(14 < 15)
5. ((((6 + 4) − 3) × 2) − 4 = 10)
6. ¬¬(23 = 8)

### 2. Truth Tables

Write a function that can be used to generate a full truth table for each of the following expressions both with and without using logical connectives (!, &&, ||):

* ¬A
* A∧B
* AvB
* A⊕B
* A⇒B
* A⇔B
* (A∧B)vC

## Summary

In this section we have learned about propositional logic. In the next section we will find out about [operators in propositional logic](./logical-operators/).
