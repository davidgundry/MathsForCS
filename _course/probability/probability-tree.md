In this section we're going to see how to use probability trees to visualise conditional probabilities.

Watch the video and then answer the questions below.

## Key Points

We can represent a sequence of decisions as a **decision tree**. If we attach probabilities to each choice, we get a **probability tree**.

Each choice is labeled with it's conditional probability, i.e. "given you've got here in the tree, what is the chance you'll pick this choice".

To find the probability of a particular path through the decision tree (i.e. that a specific sequence of decisions is made), you multiply along the branches.

Because paths are mutually exclusive, you can add their probabilities to find their joint probability.

## Summary

In this section we saw probability trees.

In the next section we look at the [Law of Total Probability](../law-of-total-probability).
