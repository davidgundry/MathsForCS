## Key Points

### Discrete Random Variables

A variable that has a countable number of possible values is called a **discrete random variable** If you roll a dice, there are a countable number of possible values:

The list of probabilities for each value is the **probability function** or **probability mass function**. This gives its **probability distribution**. The list of probabilities must add up to 1.

Discrete probability distributions include:

* Binomial distribution
* Poisson distribution

### Continuous Random Variables

A variable that could take an infinite (continuous) number of values is a **continuous random variable**. For example, the height of a random student might be a continuous random varible.

It is represented by the area under a curve, or integral. This curve is a **probability density function**. The area under the curve adds up to 1. There are an infinite number of possible values, so the probability of any single value is 0.

Continuous probability distributions include:

* Normal distribution
* Exponential distribution

### Probability Distributions

**Uniform** - All outcomes are equally likely. Like rolling a fair dice.

**Normal** - The bell curve. Very common in real-world data.

**Binomial** - Models the number of successes for boolean data: coin flips, yes/no questions, etc.

**Poisson**: The Poisson (discrete) and exponential (continuous) distributions complement one another. 

Example: that there is a cross road in your area that has a lot of accidents. A Poisson distribution answers the question, “What is the probability that such‐and‐such number of accidents will occur there within a month?” 

**Exponential** distribution answers the question, “What is the probability that the time until the next accident is such‐and‐such length of time?”
