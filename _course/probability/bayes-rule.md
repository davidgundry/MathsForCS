In this section we're going to learn about Bayes Rule, which was named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, apparently.

There are two videos for this section. The first introduces Bayes' Rule, the second is a worked example.

## Key Points

Bayes' rule uses conditional probabilities to find the probability of A given B when we know \\( P(B\|A) \\), but donâ€™t know \\( P(A \\cap B ) \\). 

<p class="math">\( P(A|B) = \frac{ P(B|A) \times P(A) }{P(B)}  \)</p>

This is a rearragement of the formula for conditional probability \\( P(A \\cap B) = P(A\|B) \\times P(B) \\)

### Applying Bayes' Rule

**Question:** What is the liklihood that a student who passed their exam had revised? Assuming:

* Half of students revise
* Half of students pass their exam
* Of those who revise, 80% passed their exam

**Answer:** We can use Bayes's Rule to solve this question.

* \\(P(Revise) = 0.5 \\)
* \\(P(Pass) = 0.5 \\)
* \\(P(Pass \| Revise) = 0.8 \\)

<p class="math">\[ \frac{ P(Pass|Revise) \times P(Revise)}{P(Pass)} = \frac{ 0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8\]</p>

Therefore \\( P(Revise\|Pass) = 0.8 \\)


### Thinking like a Bayesian

We can use Bayes' rule to iteratively update our beliefs about the world. This is one of the techniques used in machine learning.

We have a hypothesis H and new evidence E.

* Our **prior probability** (\\( P(H) \\)) is how likely we think H is _before_ our new evidence.
* We want to work out the **posterior probability** (\\( P(H \| E) \\)) of our hypothesis _after_ the new evidence

We also need to know:

* the probability that our evidence itself is true (\\( P(E) \\) )
* how likely the evidence is if our hypothesis is true (\\( P(E\|H) \\))

Using Bayes rule we can find our posterior: \\(P(H\|E)= \frac{ P(E\|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}  \\)

We often want to make use of the Law of Total Probability

<p class="math">\[ P(H_1|E)= \frac{ P(E|H_1) \times P(H_1)}{\sum_{i} P(E | H_i) \times P(H_i)} \]</p>
